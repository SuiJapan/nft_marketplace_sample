# OpenSpec Instructions

These instructions are for AI assistants working in this project.

Always open `@/openspec/AGENTS.md` when the request:
- Mentions planning or proposals (words like proposal, spec, change, plan)
- Introduces new capabilities, breaking changes, architecture shifts, or big performance/security work
- Sounds ambiguous and you need the authoritative spec before coding

Use `@/openspec/AGENTS.md` to learn:
- How to create and apply change proposals
- Spec format and conventions
- Project structure and guidelines

Keep this managed block so 'openspec update' can refresh the instructions.

# CLAUDE.md
This repo uses **AGENTS.md** as the single source of truth for agent instructions
(setup, run/test commands, code style, security limits, etc.).
Please read and follow **./AGENTS.md**.
